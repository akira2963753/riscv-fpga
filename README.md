# RISC-V-CPU
**This project is based on [Computer Organization Course](https://github.com/akira2963753/5-Stage-Pipelined-MIPS-CPU) and [UC Berkeley CS 61C Summer 2025](https://cs61c.org/)**  
  
**The goal was to design a 32-bit pipelined RISC-V CPU supporting RV32I and RV32M, including Forwarding, Hazard Detection, Flush Detection, Dynamic Branch Prediction, and two Caches with AXI4-Lite Bus to BRAM. The final design was implemented and verified on FPGA. More detail can see** [**RISC-V Processor Specification File.**](./RISC-V-SPEC.pdf)
